    <p>Hi there, I’m a software developer based in London. I share pretty much everything and anything I find interesting on this blog. I hope there’s something on this blog that has caught your interest, the best way to follow this blog is using the RSS feed because I don’t normally tweet blog updates. But you are more than welcome to follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/_hdong">@_hdong</a> as well :)</p>
